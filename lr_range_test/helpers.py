    The function expects a ``model`` and ``optimizer`` for which to perform the test. This model
    is optimized with wrt. a loss function ``loss_fn``. The data is loaded from a given iterable
    (or a standard pytorch ``DataLoader``) called ``train_loader``. The loss will be calculated as
    the batch loss after each step if a ``test_loader`` is not specified. If ``test_loader`` is specified
    the loss is computed and averaged on the entirety of the test data.

    The learning rate of the model is varied from ``lr_min`` to ``lr_max`` exponentially over the course
    of ``num_steps`` iterations and smoothed with an exponential moving average with an alpha coefficient
    of ``smooth_f``. The training is stopped early if the loss diverges by a factor of more than ``diverge_th``
    from the best recorded loss.

    A custom evaluation metric such as accuracy can be specified with an
    `ignite metric <https://pytorch.org/ignite/metrics.html>`_. If the metric is expected to increase during training,
    (eg. accuracy) the ``descending`` parameter should be set to ``False``.

    The test can be run in either the interactive our automatic way depending on the value of ``automatic``.

    The results will be returned as a dictionary
